 <h1> Asymbotic relationship </h1>
 <h2>Asymptotic analysis refers to computing the running time of any operation in mathematical units of computation. In Asymptotic Analysis, the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we donâ€™t measure the actual running time) is evaluated. How the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size is also calculated.</h2>
